            <h3 class="sub-heading">What is hackXchange?</h3>
            <p>hackXchange is a hackathon, scheduled for (date) at (location), for high schoolers in Singapore. A hackathon is a competition during which students who are interested in exploring computer science or engineering team up and build projects (apps, games, robots, or whatever they're excited about) from scratch. Hackathons are a great way to show students -- especially those who might not have had much exposure to science or engineering in the past -- how fun and useful these fields can be. Today's hackathon participants will be tomorrow's makers, dreamers, and inventors.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">What makes hackXchange special?</h3>
            <p>hackXchange is different from the typical hackathon for a few reasons:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p><b>It's specifically meant for high school students.</b> Most hackathons are geared towards college students and explicitly prohibit high schoolers from attending. However, by college, most students have made up their minds about what they're interested in. High school is the perfect time to let student discover firsthand how exciting computer science and engineering can be; hackXchange would the first high school hackathon in Singapore.</p>
            <li><p><b>We're specifically focused on making hackXchange accessible to beginners.</b> We're planning to have workshops throughout the day for beginners, teaching them how to code something from scratch with no prior programming knowledge. We want students to be able to come in without having written a single line of code before and leave with a project they built from scratch. We'll also provide a special prize for beginners. Accessibility is our primary goal.</p>
            <li><p><b>It's run entirely by a team of high school students.</b> This will help us make the event engaging—we <em>are</em> our target audience—and also make hackXchange a great learning experience for the student organizers and volunteers.</p>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Why should I sponsor?</h3>
            <p>Sponsoring hackXchange is a great way to give back to the community. You'd be able to play a major role in giving local students, across different ages, skill levels, and genders, that initial "spark" that gets them hooked on computer science, engineering, or design. If you choose to send mentors or to sponsor a track prize (e.g., "Best Healthcare Hack" or "Best Mobile Hack"), you'd be able to directly help students learn the skills of the future. Your sponsorship will also help ensure that the event is completely free for students, so cost isn’t a barrier to attend.</p><p>In addition, sponsorship is a great way to promote your brand. We'd put your logo in our press releases and on our website and t-shirts, and we'd also publicly thank you during the event. hackXchange ia great way to connect with budding engineers and scientists across Singapore.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">What kind of commitment do sponsors need to make?</h3>
            <p>We need all the help we can get, so any way you can contribute is appreciated. However, we do have a couple potential sponsorship opportunities in mind. First, we need materials (like food and t-shirts for all the participants) to make the event successful, so if you're a local business who'd be willing to provide any of these items, that'd be tremendously helpful. We also need sponsors to contribute money and provide prizes; here are some suggested contributions:</p>

            <p>However, even if you don't think you'd be able to contribute at these levels, or if you're looking for something different, please get in touch! We'd love to speak with you.</p>
